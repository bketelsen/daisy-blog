## {frontmatter.title}

<p>
          Howdy! Thanks for stopping by. I&apos;m Brian Ketelsen, and I&apos;ve been doing
          technology things since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_coupler">acoustic modem couplers</a> were a thing. I love Open Source and
          exploring different programming languages. Some highlights about me and my activities:
        </p>

<ul>
          <li>Army Veteran, Bradley Fighting Vehicle Gunner, Infantry, 1st Armored Division</li>
          <li>Father of four with 19 years difference between oldest and youngest child</li>
          <li>Co-founded GopherCon, the largest conference for Go developers</li>
          <li>Co-authored <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Go-Action-William-Kennedy/dp/1617291781">Go In Action</a> for Manning Publishing</li>
          <li>
            Along with Erik St. Martin, I wrote Skynet and SkyDNS, which was eventually morphed into
            the DNS service discovery that powers Kubernetes.
          </li>
          <li>Contributor to virtual kubelet and Krustlet</li>
        </ul>

<p>
          I&apos;ve worked in a lot of interesting industries from Consumer Credit to Healthcare, in
          jobs ranging from DBA to Chief Information Officer. I&apos;m currently loving life at
          Microsoft as a Cloud Developer Advocate.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love to teach because I&apos;m always learning new things. Cloud Advocacy also gives me
          the freedom to experiment with new and interesting things every day.
        </p>

          My most exciting moment in Open Source came when I got a letter of thanks from the JPL at
          NASA for a library I wrote. They used it on one of the Rover missions.
